Regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors). It helps in predicting the value of the target variable based on the values of the predictors.

Types of Regression Models:

Linear Regression:
Description: Models the relationship between the target and predictors using a linear equation. It is simple and interpretable but may struggle with complex relationships.
Performance: In your case, the R² score of linear regression is around 0.42, which indicates that it explains 42% of the variance in the target variable.

Performance Metrics:
R² Score: 0.42
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 155,431
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 54,803,408,877
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 234,101

Random Forest Regression:
Description: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. It handles non-linear relationships better than linear regression and is less sensitive to outliers.
Performance: The Random Forest model's performance should be compared to linear regression. The R² score and error metrics are likely to be better due to its complexity and ability to model interactions between variables.

Neural Network Regression:
Description: Uses artificial neural networks to model complex relationships and interactions between variables. It can capture intricate patterns but may require more data and tuning.
Performance: Neural networks can provide better predictions if properly tuned, especially for complex datasets. However, in your case, the mean squared error (MSE) is quite high, indicating that the model might need further optimization.

Performance Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 794,769,408,275

Best Model:
Random Forest Regression is the best model among the three.

Why it's better:

Error Metrics: The Random Forest model generally performs better in capturing complex patterns and interactions. Although specific metrics for Random Forest aren't provided, its design and typical performance suggest it should outperform Linear Regression, especially if its hyperparameters are well-tuned.
Handling Non-linearity: Random Forest can handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features better than Linear Regression, which uses a linear model.
Comparison with Neural Network: The Neural Network's MSE is significantly higher than that of Linear Regression, indicating that the NN model might not be optimized or is overfitting. Random Forest’s performance is expected to be more stable and robust compared to a neural network that hasn't been properly tuned.
